# vscode_ipad

A Proof of Concept, VSCode on the iPad built with Flutter.

## Overview

* The goal of this project is to build a truely native IDE for Tablets.
* This uses native code syntax highlighting and no webviews or javascript.
* This will target Flutter.io first.
* Light mode and Dark Mode supported
* In the example it uses real code that is apart of the app to display

`lib/utils/example_code.dart`

* Parser, Highlighter and Example Code was taken from the Flutter Gallery app.
